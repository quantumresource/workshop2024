6th International Workshop on Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE 2024) for Neutral Atom Computers
https://www.quantumresource.org/

September 11, 2024 - Helsinki, Finland

==================--= Call for Papers =--==========================

Quantum computation has a growing number of promising application areas such as quantum chemistry, quantum optimisation and finance. However, the first industrially relevant and scalable quantum computer seems to be at least a decade away. Therefore, one of the most pressing questions is "How many physical qubits and how much time is necessary to execute a quantum algorithm on a selected hardware platform where the algorithmic output is more important than the fact a quantum computer was used to calculate it?"

By examining this question in depth we can motivate continued investment for quantum computing, further enable resource friendly quantum algorithm development and continue to push technological advances that will lead to a scalable quantum computing ecosystem.

The workshop will bring together researchers to discuss new methods and directions needed to develop, as soon as possible, the tools to:
* accurately analyze and benchmark complex quantum algorithms
* adapt error-correction techniques
* refine classical control and hardware microarchitectures
* enable scientifically and commercially relevant quantum applications

Research papers, tutorials, software and other demonstrations, and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the workshop. Invited talks by leading international experts will complete the program. Contributions on all areas of quantum performance analytics are welcome:
* High level quantum circuit analytics.
* Fault-tolerant quantum circuit analytics.
* Clifford+T optimisation strategies.
* Resource efficient surface code implementations.
* Surface code decoders.
* Practical quantitative analysis of surface code alternatives.
* Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) evaluation.


===== Paper submission =====

Initial submission for QRE2024 will consist of an extended abstract, limited to 2+epsilon-pages (including figures and references, please don't go nuts with the epsilon!). Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublished work, not submitted for publication elsewhere.

Upon acceptance, researchers are invited to submit full research papers to IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering.
